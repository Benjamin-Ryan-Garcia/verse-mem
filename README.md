I made this program for my local church as a way to read and memorize the Bible online. I mainly made this in Javascript, and I learned a lot about using web APIs in the process. Making this program also helped me learn a little about data processing; I had to learn how to turn the data I got from the API into something I could use for my program. Since I also have an interest in foreign languages, I implemented this program for a couple different foreign translations of the Bible.
